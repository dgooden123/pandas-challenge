  % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

2. School Summary

 Conclusions: The analysis shows that charter schools have a higher overall passing rate of 90.5% compared to district schools with only 53.7%
 Also, the schools that are smaller in size (smaller student population) have higher overall passing rates (90.1% and 91.6% for small and medium schools respectively compared to 56.6% among larger schools).
